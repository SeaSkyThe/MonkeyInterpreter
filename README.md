# MonkeyInterpreter
This is a Interpreter for the Monkey Programming Language, presented in the "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball

The core parts of the Interpreter will be:

- Lexer (Lexical Analysis)
- REPL (Read-eval-print loop / interactive mode)
- Parser (Syntax Analysis)
- Evaluator

This Interpreter is the first part of a multi-part project that I am planning to develop as a personal exercise.

Below you can see a draft of my initial idea:
