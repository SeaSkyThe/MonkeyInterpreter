# MonkeyInterpreter
This is a Interpreter for the Monkey Programming Language, presented in the "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball

The core parts of the Interpreter will be:

- Lexer (Lexical Analysis)
- REPL (Read-eval-print loop / interactive mode)
- Parser (Syntax Analysis)
- Evaluator

After that I have plans of implementing a Compiler for the same language.
